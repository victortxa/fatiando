Overview
--------

Our goal is provide a comprehensive and extensible framework
for geophysical data analysis and the development of new methodologies.

**Research:**
Make your research more **reproducible** by writing a Python script or Jupyter
notebook instead of clicking through complicated menus.

**Development:**
Don't start from scratch! Build upon the existing tools in Fatiando to develop
new methods.

**Teaching:**
Combine Fatiando with the Jupyter notebook to make rich, interactive documents.
Great for teaching fundamental concepts of geophysics!


Getting started
---------------

1. `Install Fatiando <http://www.fatiando.org/install.html>`__ and its
   dependencies.
2. Browse the `Gallery <http://www.fatiando.org/dev/gallery/index.html>`__ and
   `Cookbook <http://www.fatiando.org/cookbook.html>`__ for examples of what
   Fatiando can do.
3. Take a look at the `Documentation <http://www.fatiando.org/docs.html>`__ for
   a detailed reference of the library.
4. Get involved in the development through our `Developer Guide
   <http://www.fatiando.org/develop.html>`__.


Participating and asking for help
---------------------------------

**Subscribe** to our Google Groups mailing list to stay informed and ask for
help:
`groups.google.com/d/forum/fatiando <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/fatiando>`__

We'll post updates to the list about new releases and features, events, and
future plans for the project.
**Get involved** to help us shape the project and make it even better!

Another option for reaching out and reporting bugs is to
`open an issue on Github <https://github.com/fatiando/fatiando/issues>`__.

We have an **open development** process where everything is discussed through
`Github issues <https://github.com/fatiando/fatiando/issues>`__. Anyone can
comment and give feedback. See our `Roadmap for v1.0
<https://github.com/fatiando/fatiando/issues/102>`__ to get a feeling for where
the project is headed. **Your input is welcome!**
